\begin{itemize}
\item Fast growth of data stored online.

\item Distributed Storage Systems schemes based on erasure coding.

\item Typical situation: unreachable or failed server.

\item Recovery needs to be efficient.

\item Classical Erasure Correcting codes: recovering data typically involves accessing all surviving coordinates.

\item LRC Codes: any symbol can be recovered accessing few other symbols.
